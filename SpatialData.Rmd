# Spatial data structures
## Raster Data
<center>
- pixelated data where each pixel associated with a specific location.
- associated with:
  - an **extent** (geographic area that the raster covers),
  - a **resolution** (area covered by each pixel), and 
  - a **coordinate reference system (CRS)** (describes how location on a 2-D map is related to location on 3-D Earth)

In R, we can explore raster files with the help of several useful packages like `raster`. To illustrate, let's download a raster of land use in Arkansas, available [(here)](https://gis.arkansas.gov/product/land-use-land-cover-spring-2004-raster/).
```{r, out.height="20%", fig.align="center", fig.keep = 'last' }
library(raster)

### edit this line to point to place where raster in GeoTIFF file format is stored
ar_land_use <- raster('LULC_SUMMER_CAST2004/LULC_SUMMER_CAST2004.tif')

### plot the raster
plot(ar_land_use)

### take a look at the ar_land_use object
ar_land_use  

### raster manipulation example
ar_soy_rice <- calc(ar_land_use, 
                # substitute values for all pixels where rice/soybeans are not grown to 'NA'
                fun=function(x){x[x != 202 & x != 201] <- NA; return(x)} ) 
```

## Vector Data
<center>
- points, lines and polygons
- often stored as shapefiles (.shp)

![Image borrowed from Data Carpentry Introduction to Geospatial Concepts lesson](pnt_line_poly.png){width=40%}

</center>

```{r, out.height="20%", fig.align="center"}
library(sf)
library(maps)  # contains maps of US states with state
               # and county borders that can be retrieved as sf objects
states <- st_as_sf(map("state", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
head(states)
counties <- st_as_sf(map("county", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
counties <- subset(counties, grepl("arkansas", counties$ID))

### counties is a simple feature object of type 'MULTIPOLYGON'
str(counties)

### however, it has a different CRS than the raster we were using before
crs(counties)

### if we want to plot on the same map, we will need to reproject to the same CRS  
ar_counties_utm <- st_transform(counties, crs(ar_soy_rice))
crs(ar_counties_utm)
crs(ar_soy_rice) # now they match, we're good!

### take a quick look at the polygon data
plot(ar_counties_utm)
```

# Putting it all together: A map of rice and soybean growing areas in Arkansas in 2004
After the first exercises, you should now have the following:

1. A raster file `ar_soy_rice`containing pixels coded as either 'NA' or 202 where land use is classified as 'rice' in the map we downloaded from the AR GIS office
2. A vector file `counties` containing coordinates for polygons of Arkansas county outlines.

Now, we will build a pretty map, where the polygons are layered on top of the raster file. There are many many ways to make maps in R; for many applications I love using `tmap`, which allows you to easily customize maps with a modular, very tidyverse-style syntax. The basic structure involves two tmap elements:

```{r, out.height="20%", fig.align="center", fig.keep = 'last'}
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)

### a simple tmap
tm_shape(ar_counties_utm) + # first, specify the shape object
  tm_polygons() # second, specify the aesthetic layer(s) for each shape object

### of course, each layer can be customized in many ways
tm_shape(ar_counties_utm) +
  tm_polygons(col = "purple")

### see e.g.
?tm_borders

```

Let's include the raster file of rice-growing areas we made earlier. To do this, we will 'layer' each shape element, so that the county borders are mapped on top of the raster layer
```{r, out.height="20%", fig.align="center", fig.keep = 'last'}
### a more complicated map
tm_shape(ar_counties_utm) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "grey70") + 
tm_shape(ar_soy_rice) +
  tm_raster(palette = "viridis")

### whereas our response (soy/rice) is a categorical variable,
### it is encoded as a number, hence the continuous legend
### let's add a manual legend instead
ar_map <- tm_shape(ar_counties_utm) +
  tm_polygons() + 
tm_shape(ar_soy_rice) +
  tm_raster(palette = "viridis", legend.show = F) +
tm_add_legend("fill",
              col = viridis::viridis(5)[c(1,5)], # specifying first and fifth color from a vector of 5 colors from the viridis palette
              labels = c("Soybean","Rice"),
              title = "Land use") +
tm_layout(legend.outside = T)

ar_map

### your tmap can be saved like so:
#tmap_save(ar_map, file = "AR_land_use.pdf")
```
# Going further
1. See if you can add a scale bar with `tm_scale_bar` element. Adjust the default scale bar to have fewer breaks and not cover the southeast part of the map

2. Rearrange the layers, and/or use `tm_borders` to create a map where the county lines are visible on top of the raster layer.

3. Add a layer of points on top of the map showing your favorite cit(ies) in Arkansas. See 4f from our [PEER workshop tutorial](https://github.com/em-bellis/PEER_workshop/tree/main/4_R_Spatial_Data) for a quick overview of how to transform a data frame of point coordinates to a spatial object.
