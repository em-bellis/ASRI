Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Spatial Data in R session for the Arkansas Summer Research Institute. The goal of this session is to provide an introduction to commonly used spatial data types and R packages for visualizing geospatial data. While becoming an expert in these skills will take more time and practice than this 1 hour workshop, I hope that you will gain confidence with some of the tools and an awareness of additional resources to continue your learning afterward.  For continued learning, I highly recommend some of the free and open source learning materials available through [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-curriculum) which provides a wealth of online resources for learning data science. I also highly recommend some of the tutorials available through [rspatial.org](https://rspatial.org).

1. brief orientation to Rmarkdown
2. spatial data types (point, vector, raster)
3. map-making with the `tmap` package
